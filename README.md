## 👋 About Me

Hi! I'm Prince — a beginner in cybersecurity currently exploring hands-on learning through labs, challenges, and certifications.  

I recently completed the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**, and I’m building a strong foundation by working on home lab setups, trying out platforms like TryHackMe, and documenting what I learn along the way.

My interests include:
- Learning how attackers think 🔓
- Understanding how to defend systems 🛡️
- Building my skills with real-world tools ⚙️
